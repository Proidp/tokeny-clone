Purpose<strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>The purpose of these Terms and Conditions is to define the terms and conditions under which the Users benefits from the ONCHAINID.<\/p>\n<h2>3. Duration<\/h2>\n<p>The Agreement is available for an undetermined period of time as from the entering into thereof by the User.<\/p>\n<h2>4. Description of The ONCHAINID<\/h2>\n<h5><strong><em>4.1 Scope of the ONCHAINID<\/em><\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Tokeny provides the Users with a digital identity (the ONCHAINID) which the User may then use on compatible platforms. The BlockID®works as a verified identity available on the Distributed Ledger Network. In this respect, a SmartContract is issued on the Ethereum Network thereby establishing the ONCHAINID. Claims are then populated in the ONCHAINID.<\/p>\n<p>Claims may be populated by Tokeny (generally on behalf of the User or a qualified third party) but also by third parties. By accepting to be provided with an ONCHAINID, the User accepts the fact that third parties may populate the Claims, consult User Data or have access to User Data.<\/p>\n<p>The User\u2019s Data are hosted on Tokeny\u2019s server or its hosting subcontractor\u2019s server, enabling the remote processing and safeguarding of Data. The journals, logs and records of Tokeny, or its hosting subcontractor are used as evidence in disputed cases, which the User acknowledges.<\/p>\n<p>The User will remain the owner of the Data. When deploying an ONCHAINID, Tokeny will set up two similar management keys for the relevant identity: one key which is associated to the wallet of the User and the other key which is held by Tokeny in order to perform administration services on behalf of the User. \u00a0The User may revoke the management key of Tokeny, however, the User accepts and understands that in such case Tokeny will no longer be able to perform administration services for the User.<\/p>\n<h5><em><strong>4.2 Security<\/strong><\/em><\/h5>\n<p>Tokeny implements security measures that comply with the highest standards in force, under an obligation of means (<em>obligation de moyens<\/em>), against unauthorized access or damage to Data. Tokeny will use the best in security practices to ensure the utmost safety of its data and code. Tokeny will use every avenue available to it for security purposes and will always look at newly available security practices. While Tokeny will strive to use the best security practices, there may be instances where hackers can commit data breaches and other security breaches. Said security breaches will not be the responsibility of Tokeny. However, Tokeny will use its best efforts to secure and fix any such breach as soon as possible.<\/p>\n<h2>5. Safekeeping Services<\/h2>\n<h5><em><strong>5.1 Scope of the Safekeeping Service<\/strong><\/em><\/h5>\n<p>In addition to the ONCHAINID, Tokeny also offers access to a safekeeping service (the \u201c<strong>Safekeeping Service<\/strong>\u201d).<\/p>\n<p>The User has the ability to create a wallet for the safekeeping of its Digital Assets (the \u201c<strong>Wallet<\/strong>\u201d). After successful registration with Tokeny to that effect, the User will be provided access to the Wallet.<\/p>\n<h5><strong><em>5.2 Functionalities of the Wallet<\/em><\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The Wallet displays the Digital Assets which are held for the User. This means that the public and private keys associated to the Wallet are kept for and on behalf of the User.<\/p>\n<p>Furthermore, the User will have access to the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>the User may view the public address of his\/her wallet;<\/li>\n<li>the User can view past transactions, including the addresses of the sender and recipient of the transaction, time stamp and transaction ID;<\/li>\n<li>the User can initiate transactions;<\/li>\n<li>as the case maybe and depending on the Distributed Ledger Network on which the Wallet is created, the Wallet of the User will be pre-funded with the network currency needed to cover the network fees required to carry out transactions in Digital Assets with the User\u2019s Wallet.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h5><strong><em>5.3 Data sharing<\/em><\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Tokeny will rely on a third-party service provider for the management and holding of the Wallet. The User understands and accepts that this means that Tokeny merely grants access to the solution provided by such service provider. By creating a user account, the User will be required to accept the terms and conditions of such service provider relating to the Safekeeping Service. By accepting the present Terms and Conditions, the User also accepts the service provider\u2019s terms and conditions which are appended hereto in annex. The User furthermore understands and accepts that Tokeny may be required to share User related information with such service provider in order to enable the latter to notably comply with its legal and regulatory obligations.<\/p>\n<p>Tokeny will incur no responsibility whatsoever relating to the safekeeping of the Digital Assets as it relies on a service provider therefore. It may thus not be held responsible in case of insolvency of the third-party service provider resulting in the possible inability for the third-party service provider to restitute the Digital Assets to the User or in case of breach of notably the safekeeping duties of the service provider. Any claims in that respect will need to be raised directly with such service provider.<\/p>\n<h5><strong><em>5.4 Fees<\/em><\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The provision of a safekeeping wallet, the safekeeping of certain Digital Assets and\/or the carrying out of Digital Assets transactions pursuant to which such assets will be transferred to and from the relevant User Wallet may entail fees which will be charged accordingly to the User by Tokeny. In such case, Tokeny will issue an invoice to the User. A failure by the User to settle the invoice according to its terms might result in the Wallet of the User being blocked by Tokeny until complete payment of such invoice. Upon blocking of the Wallet, the User will have a [15] days period to settle the invoice, failure of which Tokeny will have the right to terminate the Agreement with immediate effect. Upon termination, the User will be required to provide to Tokeny information as to where the Digital Assets should be transferred. In case the User fails to provide this information to Tokeny, the Digital Assets will be kept in an internal wallet of Tokeny until the above information is provided.<\/p>\n<h2>6.

Financial Conditions<\/h2>\n<p>Tokeny may charge a fee for the provision of the BlockID®and additional related services.<\/p>\n<p>In case the BlockID®is created in the context of a Digital Assets Offering or the access of a third-party platform, the issuer of the Digital Assets Offering will generally bear the costs thereof. However, further amendments to the BlockID®or uses beyond the mere Digital Assets Offering will bear costs which may be charged to the User directly. In such case, Tokeny will provide the details of such costs to the User. The User may decide to terminate this Agreement if it does not agree with the fee charged by Tokeny. Termination will be effective immediately.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, in case the BlockID®is created in a context which is not related to that of a Digital Assets Offering or the access to third party platforms or in the case the Issuer of the Digital Assets Offering or such third-party platform have decided not to bear the cost of the creation of the ONCHAINID, the User shall bear the costs of creating and managing the ONCHAINID. Tokeny will provide the details of such costs to the Issuer beforehand. The User may decide to terminate this Agreement if it does not agree with the fee charged by Tokeny. Termination will be effective immediately.<\/p>\n<h2>8. Intellectual Property<\/h2>\n<p>Tokeny holds all rights to the ONCHAINID, including its brand and logo as well as any software, application or database Data used in the BlockID®as the case may be. Notwithstanding the above, the User remains the sole owner of its own Data.<\/p>\n<p>The right to use the BlockID®shall not have the effect of transferring any intellectual property whatsoever on any part of the BlockID®other than those strictly necessary for the use of the BlockID®by the User during the term of the Agreement, as indicated above.<\/p>\n<h2>9.

Privacy protection of a Party lasts as long as the other party intends to keep its confidential information, except in case of transmission request from a legal or judicial authority.<\/p>\n<h2>10. Personal Data<\/h2>\n<p>The User and Tokeny undertake to comply with applicable law regarding the protection of personal Data, including but not limited to GDPR, and conduct as with all necessary formalities when personal Data of data subjects is stored or processed by using the ONCHAINID. Tokeny is committed to acting on the express instructions of the User in case of request for access, correction or erasure made by a natural person.<\/p>\n<h2>11.

The User warrants and indemnifies Tokeny against any action arising from any third party.<\/p>\n<h2>12. Termination<\/h2>\n<p>Each Party may terminate the Agreement at any time during the Period.<\/p>\n<p>Since the BlockID®may depend on the infrastructure which Tokeny uses, User acknowledges Tokeny may terminate the Agreement without compensation if the host terminates its hosting service for whatever reason.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, in the event of a breach by either party to any of the obligations of the Agreement, that has not been remedied within thirty (30) calendar days after notice has been given to the breaching Party, the other Party shall be entitled to terminate the Agreement, without prejudice to any damages which it may claim. Any claim brought by the User for compensation related to any breach of the Agreement cannot exceed the total value of the Agreement terms. Where appropriate, the Parties shall implement the reversibility agreed below.<\/p>\n<p>Exceptionally, Tokeny reserves the right to automatically terminate the Agreement without notice or compensation in the event that the User or any third parties prejudice in any way the integrity of the ONCHAINID, intellectual property rights of Tokeny or image of Tokeny brand or its products.<\/p>\n<p>Upon termination of the Agreement for breach of the User, all sums paid shall be retained by Tokeny, which will charge all fees remaining due until the end of the Agreement, immediately due to the effective date of termination. Upon any termination of the Agreement for breach of exclusive Tokeny rights, Tokeny issues a credit note for any invoice for the Period contractual still to run on the date of actual termination, and keeps the fees collected and\/or past due for the Period up the effective termination.<\/p>\n<h2>13.

Such platform providers and issuers do not belong to Tangany. The relationship between Tangany and its Users as well as the Users and the platform providers or issuers must be strictly distinguished.<\/p>\n<p>The following statements do not constitute legal or tax advice. The User should consult his lawyer for legal advice and his tax advisor for tax advice.<\/p>\n<h3>B)\u00a0\u00a0 Scope of this GTC<\/h3>\n<p>The GTCs exclusively regulate the contractual relationship between Tangany and its Users.<\/p>\n<p>Tangany is the provider of the Wallet, crypto custodian and contractual partner to its Users.<\/p>\n<p>These GTCs are the sole contractual basis for the use of the Wallet.<\/p>\n<p>These GTCs do not regulate the use of any platforms or services on the platform, such as the subscription of offers of crypto assets on any platforms. Such services are provided by the respective platform operator or issuer and have no connection with Tangany. Registration on such a platform is exclusively based on separate terms and conditions of the platform operator or issuer. The platform operator may have access to the customer account and the Wallet under certain circumstances. Tangany is never liable for the platform operator or other third parties. A User is not obliged to use Tangany&#8217;s Wallet for the crypto assets acquired by him on the platform.<\/p>\n<h3>C)\u00a0 Contracting and Opening of Account<\/h3>\n<p>The contract is concluded and an account opened for the use of the Wallet after registration of the User by Tangany.<\/p>\n<p>The registration is carried out by instructions from Tangany and is necessary for the opening of a customer account.<\/p>\n<p>After registration the User receives his customer account. The customer account enables the Uer to access the Wallet and the services which Tangany offers with the Wallet.<\/p>\n<p>After successful registration Tangany provides the User with access to his customer account and thus to the services of the Wallet.<\/p>\n<p>The opening of a customer account can be refused by Tangany if there is no successful registration.<\/p>\n<h3>D)\u00a0 Registration of the User<\/h3>\n<p>As a crypto custodian Tangany has to identify its Users and is obliged to verify their identities. This is done within the scope of the registration of the Users.<\/p>\n<p>Within the scope of the registration Tangany requires an official identification document from the User, which contains a photograph and which fulfils the passport and identification requirements in Germany (e.g. an official identity card, German driving licence or a passport). If the User is a company, further documents (e.g. extract from the commercial register) are required for registration.<\/p>\n<p>Registration of the User already takes place by communicating his personal information (&#8220;identity&#8221;), which he provides on the platform of the third party. The User&#8217;s identity is then verified (&#8220;identity verification&#8221;). Identity verification is carried out by means of a video identification procedure, for which Tangany uses a service provider.<\/p>\n<p>The User is contacted by the service provider and receives further instructions for the successful completion of the video identification procedure. The User will be informed by the service provider immediately after successful completion of the identification.<\/p>\n<p>The User must inform Tangany for the duration of the business relationship immediately of any change of name, address and e-mail address. This is done via the platform of the third party.<\/p>\n<h3>E)\u00a0\u00a0 Using the Wallet<\/h3>\n<p>After successful registration with the platform provider the User has access to the Wallet and can use it. Tangany establishes access to the Wallet for the User. Access is via the customer account provided by the platform provider.<\/p>\n<p>With access to the wallet, every User gets an overview of his\/her crypto assets stored by Tangany.<\/p>\n<p>Tangany&#8217;s wallet only displays crypto assets which the User has acquired via third party platforms and which Tangany holds in custody for the User. Other crypto assets of the User which Tangany does not keep are not in the Tangany wallet and are not displayed to the User via the customer account.<\/p>\n<p>Further functions of the wallet (exemplary list; these depend on the platform operator or third party):<\/p>\n<p>\u25cf\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The User can view the public address (public key) of his\/her wallet<\/p>\n<p>\u25cf\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the User can view past transactions, including the addresses of the sender and recipient of the transaction, time stamp and transaction ID<\/p>\n<p>\u25cf\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 depending on the wallet, the User can initiate transactions (this is a function on the Blockchain and not a service of Tangany)<\/p>\n<p>Tangany only provides crypto custody services to its Users.Tangany is responsible for ensuring that the information provided to the User is correctly reproduced as it is visible on the blockchain.\u00a0 However, Tangany is not responsible for the correctness or up-to-dateness of the entries on the blockchain, as these are outside Tangany&#8217;s sphere of influence. Tangany does not provide any investment advice and is not involved in the trading of crypto assets.Tangany will not pass on any information from the issuer of crypto assets to the Users and will not support any other measures related to the crypto assets (e.g. measures in connection with exchange or subscription rights).Insofar as legally necessary (for important reasons, in particular for supervisory and regulatory reasons) Tangany is entitled to suspend its services in whole or in part.<\/p>\n<h3>F)\u00a0\u00a0 Costs and fees for Using the Wallet<\/h3>\n<p>The opening and use of the wallet is basically free of charge for the User.The platform operator pays a separate fee to Tangany, for which the User of Tangany is not further charged.The User must pay any costs for using the Internet directly to his Internet service provider. The same applies to any costs for the transmission of crypto assets within the blockchain (&#8220;network fee&#8221;), which the User or the platform operator must pay to the network provider.<\/p>\n<h3>G)\u00a0 Rules for Using the Wallet<\/h3>\n<p>The following rules apply for successful account opening and further use:<\/p>\n<p>\u25cf\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The User must be at least 18 years old<\/p>\n<p>\u25cf\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The User must have his permanent residence in an accepted country<\/p>\n<p>\u25cf\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The User must act in his\/her own name and may not open or maintain an account for other persons<\/p>\n<p>\u25cf\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The User must use his\/her own e-mail address<\/p>\n<p>\u25cf\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The User must accept the GTC in the currently valid form<\/p>\n<p>\u25cf\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The User must complete the registration and have updates made if necessary (if changes occur in his person, in the legal situation or from external circumstances)<\/p>\n<p>\u25cf\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The use of the wallet must not violate German and\/or international law (which are directly applicable to Tangany or the User)<\/p>\n<p>\u25cf\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The User may not program applications that interact with the Wallet unless Tangany has given its explicit written consent<\/p>\n<p>\u25cf\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The User may not use spider, robot or crawling programs or other technical and\/or automated solutions to access or extract data from the Wallet<\/p>\n<p>\u25cf\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The User is obliged to inform himself\/herself about his\/her rights regarding the stored crypto assets.<\/p>\n<p>Tangany or third parties can only access the respective User&#8217;s crypto assets with the User&#8217;s express consent.Upon request, Tangany will inform each issuer about the identity of all Users who own crypto assets issued by the issuer within Tangany\u2019s wallet.The wallet may only be used by the User himself\/herself. If the User learns that someone has unauthorized access to his\/her wallet he\/she must inform Tangany immediately.<\/p>\n<h3>H)\u00a0 Taxes<\/h3>\n<p>The User is responsible for the proper taxation of her\/his activities with crypto assets. Tangany will not be active here unless there is a legal obligation to do so.<\/p>\n<h3>I)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Availability of the Wallet<\/h3>\n<p>Tangany operates the wallet with the greatest possible availability.However, there is no guaranteed availability of the Wallet. For example, the wallet may not be available due to maintenance, further development or other events beyond Tangany&#8217;s control, e.g. the interruption of power and\/or data connections or a restriction in the use of the platform.Tangany reserves the right to discontinue, restrict or change the wallet or individual components of the wallet temporarily &#8211; for example for technical or legal reasons. Tangany will inform the User and the respective platform operator in advance of any forthcoming changes.<\/p>\n<h3>J)\u00a0\u00a0 Single User Accounts and Omnibus User Accounts<\/h3>\n<p>The platform provider may choose between two types of wallets for the custody of crypto assets: wallets managed in accordance with the single user account segregation (&#8220;Single User Accounts&#8221;) and the omnibus user account segregation (&#8220;Omnibus User Accounts&#8221;). The Single User Account is used to hold the crypto assets of a single User. Consequently, the User&#8217;s crypto assets are kept separate from the crypto assets of the other Users and of Tangany&#8217;s own holdings. The Omnibus User Account is used for joint custody of multiple Users&#8217; crypto assets. However, Tangany does not hold its own assets in Omnibus User Accounts.<\/p>\n<h3>Essential legal framework of the degrees of separation<\/h3>\n<p>\u25cf\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <strong>Insolvency law<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Subject to applicable local insolvency law, Users&#8217; legal title to crypto assets held directly in wallets by Tangany on behalf of Users should not be affected by an insolvency of Tangany, regardless of whether the crypto assets are held in Single User Accounts or Omnibus User Accounts. In practice, the allocation of crypto assets in the event of insolvency depends on a number of factors. The most important ones are discussed below.<\/p>\n<p>\u25cf\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <strong>Application of insolvency law in Tangany\u00b4s jurisdiction.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If Tangany becomes insolvent, insolvency proceedings would take place in the jurisdiction applicable to Tangany and would be subject to local, i.e. German, insolvency law. Under German insolvency law, crypto assets held in custody by Tangany on behalf of Users would not be included in the insolvency estate to be distributed to creditors, provided that such crypto assets are still owned by the Users (it should be noted, however, that there is not yet a unanimous legal opinion on the ownership treatment of crypto assets; this is currently being clarified by the legislature). Rather, they would have to be surrendered to the Users in accordance with their respective ownership rights or shares. Accordingly, cryptocurrencies held in custody by Tangany for Users of which Tangany is not the issuer and which are deemed to be the property of such Users and not the property of Tangany should be protected in the event of Tangany&#8217;s insolvency or liquidation. This is true regardless of whether the crypto assets are held on an Omnibus User Account or Single User Accounts. Users could also have a priority claim with respect to certain assets in the event of insolvency proceedings. This would be the case if, at the time of the insolvency proceedings, the User does not yet have an ownership interest in a crypto asset, but has already fulfilled its obligations to Tangany arising from the respective crypto transaction. Such a situation could arise if a User acquires crypto assets as part of a crypto transaction but has not yet acquired title to those crypto assets or, if Tangany has wrongfully infringed the User&#8217;s title to the crypto assets. In these cases, a User would have a priority claim if, at the commencement of the bankruptcy proceeding, the User had<\/p>\n<p>&#8211;\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 has fully performed its obligations to Tangany under the relevant crypto transaction, or<\/p>\n<p>&#8211;\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 has not fully performed its obligations, but the unperformed portion corresponds to less than 10 percent of the value of its crypto claim and the User performs its obligations within one week after being requested to do so by the insolvency administrator.<\/p>\n<p>In such cases, the User&#8217;s priority claim would be satisfied separately from the claims of non-preferred unsecured creditors. The claim would be settled out of existing crypto assets of the same type that are part of Tangany&#8217;s insolvency estate or claims that Tangany has in respect of the delivery of crypto assets of the same type in Tangany&#8217;s insolvency estate. Users would then have to make a claim as priority creditors in respect of those crypto assets in the event of Tangany&#8217;s insolvency.<\/p>\n<p>\u25cf\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <strong>Type of User claims<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Tangany holds the crypto assets in custody on behalf of the Users, who are entitled to ownership of these crypto assets by law. This applies both in the case of Single User Accounts and Omnibus User Accounts. However, User claims differ depending on the custody on Single User Accounts and Omnibus User Accounts. In the case of a Single-User Account, each User has a claim to all crypto assets held in the Single User Account. Because crypto assets of different Users are held in common in a single account, in the case of an Omnibus User Account, each User is generally deemed to have a claim to all crypto assets held in the Omnibus User Account pro rata to its crypto asset holdings. Subject to applicable local law, Tangany&#8217;s records on the Blockchain will serve as evidence of Tangany&#8217;s Users&#8217; entitlement to the crypto assets. The reliability of this evidence would be particularly important in the event of insolvency. Tangany undertakes to distinguish crypto assets held in custody for one User from crypto assets held in custody for another User and its own crypto assets. Compliance with these rules is monitored as part of regular audit checks.<\/p>\n<p>In the event of insolvency, the User can separate his\/her crypto assets from the custody and have them transferred to one of his\/her other wallets for a fee. This applies both to custody on Single User Accounts and to custody on Omnibus User Accounts.<\/p>\n<h3>K)\u00a0 Limitation of Liability<\/h3>\n<p>Tangany has unlimited liability for intent and gross negligence and for any culpable injury to life, body or health.Otherwise, Tangany is not liable for lack of economic success, loss of profit and indirect damages in the event of a slightly negligent breach of its essential contractual obligations. An essential contractual obligation in this sense is an obligation, the fulfilment of which makes the implementation of the contract possible in the first place and on the fulfilment of which the User may therefore regularly rely.The liability for slightly negligent breaches of essential contractual obligations is limited to the typical and foreseeable damage at the time of conclusion of the contract.The liability of Tangany in case of data loss is limited to the costs that would have been incurred even if the User had carried out a proper data backup to restore the data. This limitation does not apply to data protection violations against the basic data protection regulation.<\/p>\n<h3>L)\u00a0\u00a0 Indemnification and Compensation<\/h3>\n<p>The User indemnifies Tangany from any claims of third parties to which Tangany is exposed due to a breach of contract or unauthorised action by the User, insofar as the User is responsible for the breach of contract or the unauthorised action.The User must compensate Tangany for any damages that Tangany incurs due to a breach of contract or unauthorised action by the User insofar as the User is responsible for the breach of contract or the unauthorised action.<\/p>\n<h3>M) Duration and Termination<\/h3>\n<p>The use of the wallet and the services of Tangany are granted to the User for an indefinite period.The User and Tangany can terminate the contractual relationship with the other contractual party at any time with a notice period of three (3) months. The termination must be made in text form (for example by e-mail or letter).<\/p>\n<p>Tangany can terminate the contract immediately if there is an important reason.<\/p>\n<p>Important reasons are in particular:<\/p>\n<p>\u25cf\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ongoing operational disruptions due to force majeure that are beyond Tangany&#8217;s control (such as natural disasters, fire or power failures for which Tangany is not responsible)<\/p>\n<p>\u25cf\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 repeated, serious breaches of the User&#8217;s obligations (see &#8220;G.

Tangany ist allerdings nicht f\u00fcr die Korrektheit oder Aktualit\u00e4t der Eintr\u00e4ge auf der Blockchain verantwortlich, da diese au\u00dferhalb des Einflussbereiches von Tangany liegen. Tangany erbringt keine Anlageberatung und ist nicht am Handel von Kryptowerten beteiligt.Tangany wird keine Informationen der Emittenten von Kryptowerten an die Nutzer weitergeben und keine sonstigen, auf die Kryptowerte bezogenen Ma\u00dfnahmen (z.B.

So kann die Wallet aufgrund von Wartung, Weiterentwicklung oder anderer Ereignisse, die au\u00dferhalb des Einflussbereiches von Tangany liegen, z.B. die Unterbrechung von Strom- und\/oder Datenverbindung oder eine Einschr\u00e4nkung der Nutzung der Plattform liegen, nicht verf\u00fcgbar sein.<\/p>\n<p>Tangany beh\u00e4lt sich das Recht vor, die Wallet oder einzelne Komponenten der Wallet zeitweise \u2013 zum Beispiel aus technischen oder rechtlichen Gr\u00fcnden \u2013 einzustellen, einzuschr\u00e4nken oder diese zu \u00e4ndern. Tangany wird den Nutzer und den jeweiligen Plattformbetreiber \u00fcber bevorstehende \u00c4nderungen vorab informieren.<\/p>\n<h3>J)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Einzelnutzer-Konto und Omnibusnutzer-Konto<\/h3>\n<p>Der Plattformanbieter kann f\u00fcr die Verwahrung von Kryptowerten zwischen zwei Arten von Wallets w\u00e4hlen: gem\u00e4\u00df der Einzelnutzer-Kontentrennung (\u201eEinzelnutzer-Konten\u201c) und der Omnibusnutzer-Kontentrennung (\u201eOmnibusnutzer-Konten\u201c) gef\u00fchrte Wallets. Das Einzelnutzer-Konto wird zur Verwahrung der Kryptowerte eines einzelnen Nutzers verwendet. Die Kryptowerte des Nutzers werden folglich getrennt von den Kryptowerten der \u00fcbrigen Nutzer und Tangany\u2018s Eigenbest\u00e4nde verwahrt. Das Omnibusnutzer-Konto wird zur gemeinsamen Verwahrung der Kryptowerte mehrerer Nutzer verwendet. Tangany h\u00e4lt ihre Eigenbest\u00e4nde jedoch nicht auf Omnibusnutzer-Konten.<\/p>\n<h3>Wesentliche rechtliche Rahmenbedingungen der Trennungsgrade<\/h3>\n<p>\u25cf\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <strong>Insolvenzrecht<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Vorbehaltlich des jeweils geltenden lokalen Insolvenzrechts sollte der Rechtsanspruch der Nutzer auf die von Tangany f\u00fcr die Nutzer direkt in den Wallets gehaltenen Kryptowerte von einer Insolvenz von Tangany nicht betroffen sein, ungeachtet dessen, ob die Kryptowerte auf Einzelnutzer-Konten- oder Omnibusnutzer-Konten gehalten werden. In der Praxis ist die Zuteilung der Kryptowerte im Insolvenzfall von einer Reihe von Faktoren abh\u00e4ngig. Auf die wichtigsten wird nachfolgend eingegangen.<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u25cf\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Anwendung des Insolvenzrechts in dem Rechtskreis von Tangany<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Falls Tangany zahlungsunf\u00e4hig wird, w\u00fcrde ein Insolvenzverfahren in der f\u00fcr Tangany geltenden Rechtsordnung stattfinden und lokalem, das hei\u00dft deutschem, Insolvenzrecht unterliegen. Gem\u00e4\u00df dem deutschen Insolvenzrecht w\u00fcrden Kryptowerte, die Tangany im Auftrag von Nutzern verwahrt, nicht der an die Gl\u00e4ubiger zu verteilenden Insolvenzmasse zugeordnet, sofern diese Kryptowerte noch im Eigentum der Nutzer stehen (zu beachten gilt hier jedoch, dass es zur eigentumsrechtlichen Behandlung von Kryptowerten noch keine einhellige Rechtsauffassung existiert; dies wird derzeit gesetzgeberisch klargestellt). Sie w\u00e4ren vielmehr entsprechend den jeweiligen Eigentumsrechten bzw. -anteilen der Nutzer an diese herauszugeben. Dementsprechend sollten Kryptowerte, die Tangany f\u00fcr Nutzer verwahrt, deren Emittent Tangany nicht ist und die als das Eigentum dieser Nutzer und nicht als Eigentum von Tangany gelten, bei einer Insolvenz von Tangany oder Abwicklung gesch\u00fctzt sein. Dies gilt unabh\u00e4ngig davon, ob die Kryptowerte auf einem Omnibus Nutzerkonto oder Einzelnutzer Konto verwahrt werden. Auch k\u00f6nnten Nutzer bei einem Insolvenzverfahren einen vorrangigen Anspruch in Bezug auf bestimmte Verm\u00f6genswerte haben. Dies w\u00e4re der Fall, wenn der Nutzer zum Zeitpunkt des Insolvenzverfahrens zwar noch kein Eigentumsrecht an einem Kryptowert hat, jedoch seine Verpflichtungen Tangany gegen\u00fcber aus der jeweiligen Krypto-Transaktion bereits erf\u00fcllt hat. Eine solche Situation k\u00f6nnte eintreten, wenn ein Nutzer Kryptowerte im Rahmen einer Krypto-Transaktion erwirbt, aber noch kein Eigentumsrecht an diesen Kryptowerten erworben hat oder, wenn Tangany das Eigentumsrecht des Nutzers an den Kryptowerten unrechtm\u00e4\u00dfig verletzt hat. In diesen F\u00e4llen h\u00e4tte ein Nutzer einen vorrangigen Anspruch, wenn er zu Beginn des Insolvenzverfahrens<\/p>\n<p>&#8211;\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 seine Verpflichtungen Tangany gegen\u00fcber aus der jeweiligen Kryptotransaktion vollst\u00e4ndig erf\u00fcllt hat oder<\/p>\n<p>&#8211;\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 seine Verpflichtungen zwar nicht vollst\u00e4ndig erf\u00fcllt hat, der nicht erf\u00fcllte Teil jedoch weniger als 10 Prozent des Werts seines Kryptolieferanspruchs entspricht und der Nutzer seinen Verpflichtungen innerhalb einer Woche nach entsprechender Aufforderung durch den Insolvenzverwalter nachkommt.<\/p>\n<p>In solchen F\u00e4llen w\u00fcrde der vorrangige Anspruch des Nutzers getrennt von den Anspr\u00fcchen nicht bevorrechtigter, unbesicherter Gl\u00e4ubiger erf\u00fcllt. Der Anspruch w\u00fcrde aus bestehenden Kryptowerten derselben Art beglichen, die Teil der Insolvenzmasse von Tangany oder von Anspr\u00fcchen sind, die Tangany in Bezug auf die Lieferung von Kryptowerten derselben Art in Tangany\u2018s Insolvenzmasse hat. Nutzer m\u00fcssten im Fall einer Insolvenz von Tangany einen Anspruch dann als vorrangige Gl\u00e4ubiger in Bezug auf diese Kryptowerte geltend machen.<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u25cf\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Art der Nutzeranspr\u00fcche<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Tangany verwahrt die Kryptowerte im Auftrag der Nutzer, denen von Rechts wegen ein Eigentumsrecht an diesen Kryptowerten zusteht. Dies gilt sowohl im Fall von Einzelnutzer-Konten als auch von Omnibusnutzer-Konten. Jedoch unterscheiden sich die Nutzeranspr\u00fcche je nach der Verwahrung auf Einzelnutzer-Konten und Omnibusnutzer-Konten. Bei einem Einzelnutzer-Konto hat jeder Nutzer einen Anspruch an allen auf dem Einzelnutzer-Konto gehaltenen Kryptowerten. Da die Kryptowerte von unterschiedlichen Nutzern gemeinsam auf einem einzigen Konto verwahrt werden, wird bei einem Omnibusnutzer-Konto in der Regel davon ausgegangen, dass jeder Nutzer einen Anspruch an allen auf dem Omnibusnutzer-Konto verwahrten Kryptowerten anteilig zu seinem Kryptowertebestand hat. Vorbehaltlich anwendbaren lokalen Rechts dienen Tangany\u2018s Aufzeichnungen auf der Blockchain als Nachweis f\u00fcr die Anspr\u00fcche der Nutzer von Tangany an den Kryptowerten. Die Verl\u00e4sslichkeit dieses Nachweises w\u00e4re insbesondere im Fall der Insolvenz von gro\u00dfer Wichtigkeit. Tangany verpflichtet sich f\u00fcr einen Nutzer verwahrte Kryptowerte von den f\u00fcr einen anderen Nutzer verwahrten und eigenen Kryptowerten zu unterscheiden. Die Einhaltung dieser Regeln wird im Rahmen regelm\u00e4\u00dfiger Revisionspr\u00fcfungen \u00fcberwacht.<\/p>\n<p>Im Falle der Insolvenz kann der Nutzer seine Kryptowerte aus der Verwahrung trennen und kostenpflichtig auf einer seiner sonstigen Wallets \u00fcbertragen lassen. Dies gilt sowohl f\u00fcr die Verwahrung auf Einzelnutzer-Konten als auch f\u00fcr die Verwahrung auf Omnibusnutzer-Konten.<\/p>\n<h3>K)\u00a0\u00a0 Haftungsausschluss<\/h3>\n<p>Tangany haftet f\u00fcr Vorsatz und grobe Fahrl\u00e4ssigkeit sowie wegen jeglicher schuldhaften Verletzung des Lebens, des K\u00f6rpers oder der Gesundheit unbeschr\u00e4nkt.Ansonsten haftet Tangany bei einer leicht fahrl\u00e4ssigen Verletzung seiner wesentlichen Vertragspflichten nicht f\u00fcr mangelnden wirtschaftlichen Erfolg, entgangenen Gewinn und mittelbare Sch\u00e4den.
