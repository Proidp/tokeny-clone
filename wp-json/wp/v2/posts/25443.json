The STO is part of Mash\u2019s broader equity round. Mash is also partnering with DLA Piper UK LLP as legal adviser and has selected Deloitte to support AML and KYC requirements.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Security Tokens offer many benefits, and are expected to make up 10% of global GDP &#8211; roughly <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cryptovibes.com\/crypto-news\/security-tokens-to-bring-10-of-global-gdp-8-trillion-into-the-blockchain-ecosystem-by-2024\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">$8 trillion<\/a> by 2024. Tokenized securities represent assets &#8211; such as equity, debt\/loans, or investment funds and reflect an expectation of future cash flows resulting from the activity of the issuer. Security tokens are therefore subject to financial security regulations, just like any other security.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\">Mash on the Partnership<\/h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\">James Hickson, Mash CEO, talked about the partnership, \u201cAs we looked at delivering Europe\u2019s first STO, it was critical we worked with the right team. One of the great things about <span class=\"s1\">Tokeny<\/span> is the talent they bring to the table, it\u2019s not just about blockchain, it\u2019s about fundamentally understanding the implications for digital securities. We\u2019ve been hugely impressed, not only with the platform but the partnership and approach that Tokeny have brought to the table.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<h3 class=\"p1\">Tokeny on the Partnership<\/h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\">Luc Falempin, CEO of Tokeny, commented, \u201cMash is a visionary in identifying the issuance of security tokens on the blockchain as a new way to reach investors. This is completely in line with Tokeny\u2019s vision to deliver an end-to-end technology platform supporting the issuance and management of security tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. We aim at shielding the issuer from the technicalities of the blockchain and making the subscription process as simple as possible for their investors.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<h3>Why Mash Has Launched a Security Token Offering<\/h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\">Mash CEO, James Hickson mentioned, \u201cWe continue to look for ways to innovate. When we considered how to approach our equity round, exploring the intersection of blockchain technology and the potential to tap into a new investor pool was interesting. \u201d says Hickson. &#8220;Specifically, we felt that expanding a traditional securities offering to include security tokens was a novel approach to the fundraising process by opening up the offer to a different kind of sophisticated investor that is interested in developing a portfolio of digital assets.&#8221;<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<h4 class=\"p1\"><b>About Tokeny<\/b><\/h4>\n<p class=\"p1\">The Luxembourg based fintech company, hosted at the Luxembourg House of Financial Technology (The LHoFT), is the market leader in delivering an institutional grade, secure end-to-end platform, allowing for the issuance and lifecycle management of tokens.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Tokeny<\/span> provide a set of solutions, the T-REX (Token for Regulated EXchanges) infrastructure, to ensure native compliance at the issuance and trading of digital securities.
