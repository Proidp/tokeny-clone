The ebook is a comprehensive guide that walks issuers through the main steps involved in the process of launching a STO.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Before we get into the operational process<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> it would be useful to introduce the topic area and define tokenization in this first article. Next<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> we will publish another article on the difference between <b>utility tokens<\/b> and<b> security tokens<\/b>.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">2017 saw a huge rise in Initial Coin Offerings <span class=\"s1\">(<\/span>ICOs<span class=\"s1\">)<\/span>. This has<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> in turn<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> created a new asset class that has challenged the traditional makeup of financial markets. <a href=\"https:\/\/assets.kpmg\/content\/dam\/kpmg\/us\/pdf\/2018\/11\/institutionalization-cryptoassets.pdf\"><span class=\"s3\">ICOs presented an important innovation<\/span><\/a><span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> providing new pathways and more efficient flows for capital from a significantly wider group of investors. However<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> as the technology of blockchain developed rapidly<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> the regulatory framework has not been able to keep pace. We have seen plenty of ICOs associated with scandal and fraud<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> which has naturally caused uncertainty from issuers and shareholders.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">With ICOs in decline<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> 2018 has been called by many as the year of the shift to STOs. Security tokens are regulated and in most cases backed by underlying assets. They can produce a regular yield for their holders<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> while providing more stability and guarantees for the investors.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">2019 will be a structuring year for the industry. Efficient technologies will be released<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> traditional security service providers will enter in the market<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> investors will onboard<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> licensed exchanges will open and regulators will move forward. The first complete use cases will start delivering value to their investors and step-by-step<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> tokenized securities will become more attractive than others.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p3\"><b>What is a Security?<\/b><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\">To start with the basics<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/s\/security.asp\"><span class=\"s3\">security<\/span><\/a> is a fungible and negotiable financial instrument that holds some type of monetary value. It can represent ownership in a company<span class=\"s1\">&#8216;<\/span>s stock<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> a creditor relationship with an entity through a bond or rights to ownership as represented by an option. To keep it simple<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> a security can be broken down into three overarching categories<span class=\"s1\">;<\/span> equities<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> funds and debts.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Equity is an investment in stock issued by another company. The stock can be either private or public<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> and represents ownership of an entity. The entity could either be a corporation or a trust. Equity securities entitle the holder to some control of the entity on a pro-rata basis<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> via voting rights.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Debt represents money that is borrowed and has to be repaid. The issuer of the bond <span class=\"s1\">(<\/span>or debt<span class=\"s1\">)<\/span> owes the holders debt and is therefore generally obliged to pay them interest<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> and to pay the principal on the maturity date as stipulated in the offering documentation of the security. Typically<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> interest is paid as fixed intervals <span class=\"s1\">(<\/span>monthly<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> quarterly<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> annually<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> etc<span class=\"s1\">)<\/span>. In some cases, paying off this debt can be hard to come by, resulting in a knock-on effect that can affect personal\/business taxes that will be flagged by the IRS. If this is the case then there may be <a href=\"https:\/\/federaltaxresolution.com\">tax resolution services offer in compromise<\/a> so that people can pay off their debt in a way that suits the situation. Of course, some people may not be in a position where a payment plan can be set up, as they do not have the funds to enable this to happen. In this case, they may seek help from people like these <a href=\"https:\/\/blcattorney.com\/chapter-7-bankruptcy\/\">Milwaukee Chapter 7 Bankruptcy Attorneys<\/a> to eliminate their debt so that they can start to rebuild their finances, and their life, once again.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">An investment fund is a supply of capital belonging to numerous investors used to collectively purchase securities. Each investor retains ownership and control of their own shares. The same principle can be tokenized and the tokens can represent shares in the fund.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p3\"><b>What is Tokenization?<\/b><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Security tokenization is the process of materializing the ownership in a security through the issuance of a <\/b><span class=\"s1\">&#8220;<\/span><b>token<\/b><span class=\"s1\">&#8220;<\/span><b> registered on a distributed ledger technology <\/b><span class=\"s1\">(<\/span><b>DLT<\/b><span class=\"s1\">)<\/span><b> infrastructure<\/b>. Therefore<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> tokenized securities can be equities<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> a bonds<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> or investment funds. It could also represent a securitized fraction of a real asset <span class=\"s1\">(<\/span>e.g. a piece of art<span class=\"s1\">)<\/span>.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The DLT infrastructure used to issue the tokens can<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> depending on the legislation and the choice of the issuer<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> either be the <span class=\"s1\">&#8220;<\/span>primary register<span class=\"s1\">&#8220;<\/span> for the security or a representation in the form of tokens primarily issued on a different infrastructure outside of the blockchain.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">For the purpose of this Ebook<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> we will refer to these tokens as <span class=\"s1\">\u2018<\/span>security tokens<span class=\"s1\">&#8216;<\/span> and we will detail how they work in the following section. Most players in this emerging industry refrain from calling these <span class=\"s1\">\u2018<\/span>digital securities<span class=\"s1\">&#8216;,<\/span> as the term is too vague<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> and in fact<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> securities have been traded digitally for years.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Our world is full of these securities<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> but many are currently difficult to physically transfer or subdivide<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> so buyers and sellers instead trade paper or unsecured digital files that represent some or all of the asset. These systems are cumbersome<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> difficult to transfer and can be hard to track. The underlying assets can also lack transferability: For example<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> if the underlying asset is a piece of property<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> transferring the ownership of that asset requires it to be sold. Through tokenization<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> the rights of these assets can be shared almost instantaneously thanks to peer-to-peer trading. This is one advancement of many when applying blockchain technology in financial markets<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> other use cases are explained later in this Ebook.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p3\"><b>What are Tokenized Securities?<\/b><\/h3>\n<p>Tokenized securities are representations of securities in the form of tokens that have been issued on a digital infrastructure, such as blockchain. Just like traditional securities, they can take the form of a range of different financial instruments, including equity, funds and bonds.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Therefore, to understand security tokens<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> it<span class=\"s1\">&#8216;<\/span>s fundamental to understand securities. With securities<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> it<span class=\"s1\">&#8216;<\/span>s mandatory to respect the relevant laws and regulation for every jurisdiction the assets are issued in<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> and in every jurisdiction the securities will be distributed. As you might expect<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> the exact same process is needed when issuing security tokens on a blockchain.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><b>This content is inspired by the Ebook Tokenized Securities. <\/b><a href=\"https:\/\/tokeny.com\/tokenized-securities\/\"><span class=\"s3\"><b>Click here<\/b><\/span><\/a><b> to download.<\/b><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It was clear to us that people in the industry didn&#8217;t know what a STO was, so we decided to create a resource that would be able to help people understand it better.
