We highlighted the difference between <b>utility tokens<\/b> and<b> security tokens <\/b>in <a href=\"https:\/\/tokeny.com\/how-to-launch-a-sto-utility-tokens-vs-security-tokens\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s3\">part two<\/span><\/a>. <b>Compliance aware tokens<\/b> was the topic of discussion in <a href=\"https:\/\/tokeny.com\/how-to-launch-a-sto-compliance-aware-tokens\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s3\">part three<\/span><\/a>. However<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> you might still be asking why tokenization? &nbsp;Why replace processes that have existed for decades?<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; <\/span>In this article<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> we will tell you a number of benefits when comparing security tokens and finance methods that operate today. The next article will be on <b>challenges for traditional asset tokenization<\/b>.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p3\"><b>Automation <\/b><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\">A number of service functions that are currently carried out by middlemen can be automated through the blockchain. Currently<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> these various levels of intermediation often complicate communication between the issuer of a security and his investors. Each intermediary maintains its own ledger of data<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> and while central intermediaries maintain aggregated records<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> the parties<span class=\"s1\">\u2019<\/span> ledgers can <span class=\"s3\">differ quite substantially<\/span>. Every level of holding needs to perform position reconciliations with the previous ones which represents an important and costly operational process <span class=\"s1\">(<\/span>not to mention the cost of reconciliation breaks needing to be fixed<span class=\"s1\">)<\/span>. Through a STO<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> <b>the processes can be simplified and automated via smart contracts<\/b><span class=\"s1\">,<\/span><b> and also by sharing the same information.<\/b> Issuers offer shares directly to investors<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> making the information accurate<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> transparent and immutable.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p3\"><b>Shared information and Transparency<\/b><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\">Security Tokens<b> eliminate the asymmetry of information<\/b> that is present during the actual transfer of ownership of a specific security. Using the blockchain as a central source of truth<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> is shared by every player on the value chain. The tokenization of securities on a blockchain will also make governance and ownership more transparent and reliable than a traditional private security offering.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p3\"><b>Cost-effective <\/b><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\">In the traditional securities markets<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> middlemen charge significant fees for their services. These fees charged by those intermediaries pile-up to be paid by the end-investor<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> adding another barrier to entry. By using blockchain technology and smart contracts<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> <b>issuers can cut out many of the typical<\/b><span class=\"s1\">,<\/span><b> low-value added<\/b><span class=\"s1\">,<\/span><b> expensive<\/b><span class=\"s1\">,<\/span><b> intermediaries that are needed for offerings<\/b>. &nbsp;This in turn will re-create the links<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> allowing the issuers and their investors to have more direct relationship with one another.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p3\"><b>Immutability<\/b><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\">Financial institutions currently rely on private databases. In these internal systems there are different levels of access for the users that operate the database. In the lowest form<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> there will be users with read-only access<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> who will not be able to change any data. Usually there will be at least one user with a higher level of access<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> such as a systems administrator<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> and they may be able to make amendments to existing data. Investors and regulators need to trust organisations because there is no control mechanism making the data immutable in the first place. This is where blockchains can add substantial value. <b>Once an investor buys tokens on a blockchain<\/b><span class=\"s1\">,<\/span><b> nobody can erase the history of his ownership<\/b>. Once data has been written to a blockchain<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> i.e. after a transaction has occurred<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> nobody<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> not even a system administrator<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> can change it. This is highly beneficial when it comes to auditing<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> as you can prove your data hasn<span class=\"s1\">\u2019<\/span>t been altered<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> reducing time and costs.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p3\"><b>Inclusivity<\/b><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\">Global reach and lower fees of the blockchain infrastructure allows for a new breed of investor and the potential for a worldwide investor base. <b>The ability to divide the underlying assets into smaller units<\/b><span class=\"s1\">,<\/span><b> making it more affordable for some investors and easier to transfer<\/b><span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> allows for fractional ownership. Investing in an apartment<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> for example<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> could cost too much and might make it difficult to sell later<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> but owning a fractional share in the whole building could be cheaper to buy and easier to sell.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p3\"><b>Liquidity <\/b><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\">Privately issued securities are often difficult to trade and therefore have been highly illiquid. The use of <b>blockchain allows value to circulate more easily by bringing online trust<\/b><span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> as it prevents the <span class=\"s1\">\u201c<\/span>double spending<span class=\"s1\">\u201d<\/span> problem. The ability to fractionalize tangible assets through tokenization can also bring liquidity into these markets that have had little to no access to it. Traditionally<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> private securities could only be traded on secondary markets after using an extensive amount of middlemen and following strict<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> difficult to navigate regulations. By streamlining and automating these processes and <b>by using a common distributed infrastructure<\/b><span class=\"s1\">,<\/span><b> companies can remove the burdensome hurdles that previously restricted the liquidity of their securities<\/b>. Secondary markets will also offer increased liquidity through a constant 24\/7\/365 trading market.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p3\"><b>Speed<\/b><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Fast digital transfer of ownership<\/b><span class=\"s1\">,<\/span><b> T+0 settlement<\/b><span class=\"s1\">,<\/span><b> 24\/7\/365:<\/b> This results in increased liquidity and the opportunity for investors to transfer or sell their tokens after they<span class=\"s1\">\u2019<\/span>ve been issued. This is fairly commonplace for some traditional securities<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> in particular when they are largely distributed in the public. However<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> it<span class=\"s1\">\u2019<\/span>s far less common in other types of securities or financial instruments such as loans<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> real estate or private equity funds<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> which are generally far less liquid. Tokenizing those instruments through an STO can facilitate the transferral of these types of securities which aren<span class=\"s1\">\u2019<\/span>t always technically transferrable in their traditional form.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><b>This content is inspired by the Ebook Tokenized Securities. <\/b><a href=\"https:\/\/tokeny.com\/tokenized-securities\/\"><span class=\"s3\"><b>Click here<\/b><\/span><\/a><b> to download.<\/b><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>How to launch a Security Token Offering (STO) is a series of posts taken from the ebook we published in January, Tokenized Securities.
