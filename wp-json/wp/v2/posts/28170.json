The French multinational bank<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> has declared tokenization <span class=\"s1\">\u2018<\/span>reduces cost and the number of intermediaries<span class=\"s1\">&#8216;,<\/span> whilst the advisory giant Deloitte stated the process is effective <span class=\"s1\">\u2018<\/span>by greatly reducing the friction involved in the creation<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> buying and selling of securities.<span class=\"s1\">&#8216;<\/span> The World Economic Forum also made its position clear and announced <span class=\"s1\">\u2018<\/span>Blockchain will become the <span class=\"s1\">\u2018<\/span>beating heart<span class=\"s1\">&#8216;<\/span> of the global financial system.<span class=\"s1\">&#8216;<\/span> It<span class=\"s1\">&#8216;<\/span>s clear the institutional stance is positive<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> but we are yet to see this new technology transform capital markets.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Why hasn&#8217;t tokenization come to fruition? Globally, there have been many projects announced but many of the public STOs have failed to reach their fundraising targets and it&#8217;s clear that there is still some way to go before this new infrastructure is fully built. In this article I give some thoughts on the three missing bricks that are needed to build this ecosystem:<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p3\">Distributors of digital assets<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\">A company<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> an investment bank or a fund can dematerialize any kind of financial asset on the blockchain. Although the tokenization process can happen at anytime in the lifecycle of a security<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> for the moment it is mostly considered with new issuances<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> and when the issuer is in the most frequent contact with their investors. Here<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> the argument is strong to convince issuers on tokenization as they can propose a fully <b>digital experience<\/b><span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> increase transferability and improve the operational efficiency for their investors.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">As a result<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> issuers are currently looking for the <b>global reach brought by the combined powers of blockchain and internet technologies<\/b>. In principle<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> if they apply compliance properly to the onboarding processes for their investors<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> a STO allows the issuer to target a much wider audience than a standard issuance. By seeking legal advice and using a tokenization platform to enforce these rules and regulations into the tokens<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> issuers can target investors from across the globe with greater ease and efficiency.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">So what<span class=\"s1\">&#8216;<\/span>s missing? As a new form of capital raising<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> the distribution networks are not ready yet. As it stands<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> issuers have to invest in communication <span class=\"s1\">(<\/span>time and\/or marketing<span class=\"s1\">)<\/span> and education to attract and convert investors. Investors need to be able to discover tokenized investment opportunities<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> and this is very difficult without <b>professional marketplaces.<\/b> Such marketplaces need to be digital to fully benefit from the capabilities of blockchain. Investors need to be able to onboard themselves and self-custody their tokenized assets. In an ideal world<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> they should be able to list and filter the offerings depending on their attributes<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> and participate in a compliant way. Robot advisors<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> neo-banks<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> DEX and specialized marketplaces will start listing tokenized investment opportunities one by one.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Finally<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> <b>asset managers and broker-dealers<\/b> should be aware of the tokenized opportunities and include them in their investment strategies. These players could become the main drivers and users of these marketplaces. They should also comprehend the legal and compliance needs to avoid investment errors. Additionally, just as non-digital assets are legally monitored, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.secatty.com\/legal-blog\/sec-investigations\/\">the SEC can investigate brokers<\/a> and other financial professionals who are responsible for the securities laws associated with tokenized assets. <\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p3\">Auditable quality of tokenized assets<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\">As a nascent space<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> there is a low supply of quality STOs<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> and the market is driven by early adopters. As a result<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> tokenization is the main argument to find and convince investors<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> whereas the <b>underlying asset<\/b> should be the most important piece of information to assess the credibility of a project. Security tokens represent the value of the underlying asset on the blockchain<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> but details such as the number of tokens and the amount issuers want to raise can often lead to confusion.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">We are in a new industry<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> one where traditional auditors and <b>rating agencies<\/b> are not very active yet. At the moment<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> it isn<span class=\"s1\">&#8216;<\/span>t easy to find the necessary information about the offering once the tokens have become accessible on the network. Technically speaking<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> most people don<span class=\"s1\">&#8216;<\/span>t know how to read information on the blockchain and computer systems built on DLT are alien to many.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">To make decisions<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> investors and asset managers need to be able to verify <b>who issued the tokens<\/b><span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> if the underlying asset is true and valuable<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> and if the price per token is fair. Thanks to the issuance platform<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> this information can be shared with interested investors on the issuer website. However<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> on marketplaces and exchanges <span class=\"s1\">(<\/span>especially decentralized ones<span class=\"s1\">),<\/span> how do investors verify this information and assess the risk\/opportunities? Perhaps tokens could embed this information and carry them wherever they go. To enable this<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> wallets<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> marketplaces<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> tools<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> would need to evolve but it would bring transparency and efficiency as everybody would share the same data set in an interoperable network.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p3\">Technical tools for security tokens<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\">Ethereum is ready to welcome security tokens to tokenize assets on private markets. The capabilities of smart contracts are impressive<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> and thanks to permissioned tokens<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> transfers can be completed in a few minutes by automatically enforcing compliance obligations. This is a great advancement<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> as the regulation is now embedded within the financial instrument. It gives a lot of control to the issuer<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> even on a public blockchain. Security token and onchain identity standards are live and are beginning to be used by issuers. For the moment we continue to use Ethereum<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> but as technology advances<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> it is important to keep the debate open about the best blockchain for security tokens. However<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> there is no doubt that it should be a permissionless one in order to bring true <b>interoperability<\/b> and a sufficient level of resilience.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Wallets<\/b> and digital assets custodian services are not ready yet. It is still complicated for investors to setup a recognized multi-sig and secure wallet. Moreover<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> investors don<span class=\"s1\">&#8216;<\/span>t tend to know that a STO is a centralized offering controlled by the issuer: If they lose access to their wallet<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> the issuer can burn the lost tokens and re-allocate the tokens in another wallet.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Most security tokens are issued on Ethereum and based on ERC20 functions<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> but they are permissioned. This means the tokens will only be transferred if a <b>validator system confirms the compliance<\/b> of the trade<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> and especially if the buyer is eligible to receive the token. With most ERC20 compatible wallets<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> investors will be able to receive their tokens. However<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> when they try to send them to someone else the transaction will not happen because of a reason not known to the investor. Wallet providers should make an effort to return the error message to the sender<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> and invite the receiver to become eligible.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Finally<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> the main tool the industry needs is <b>a recognized stablecoin<\/b>. It would allow a high level of automation and enable stakeholders to manage the cash leg of transactions. It is great to have tokenized assets but if we don<span class=\"s1\">&#8216;<\/span>t have tokenized money<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> we still need connections with the existing financial computer systems and this is slowing down the adoption of the blockchain as a legitimate infrastructure. As everyone is aware<span class=\"s1\">,<\/span> investors will not invest in promising investment opportunities with 5-10% of annual yield by using crypto-currencies with +\/- 50% of variation every year.<\/p>\n\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"w-separator size_small\"><\/div><div class=\"cl-review type_quote layout_balloon quote_italic\"><div class=\"cl-review-quote\"><div class=\"cl-review-quote-text\" style=\"font-size:18px;background-color:#f4f4f4;\"><q>I guess we can say we are facing a chicken & egg situation: if we had more qualitative asset backed tokens, these services would develop faster.
