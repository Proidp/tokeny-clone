It is difficult to find the silver lining in times such as these but one can look at history to find solace. Times of crisis often lead to significant and long lasting innovations. Could this crisis act as a catalyst for the adoption of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs)?<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">In 1941, Alan Turing became a huge asset for the Allies when he cracked the complex Enigma code and successfully decoded German communications. By the end of the war, Turing was working on the notion that a machine could plug into the speed and resilience of electronic technology. Hardware was developed, programming implemented and computer science was born.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Times of crisis have acted as a catalyst for innovations to be used in the wider public. In 1977, Citibank invested more than $100 million in the installation of ATMs in New York, seen as a huge gamble at the time. The decision paid off when the city was hit by a blizzard forcing banks to close. ATM use rose by 20%. However, the first ATM had opened in London ten years before, showing that innovations are sometimes adopted through necessity.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Let&#8217;s not also forget, Bitcoin was also created in 2008 as a reaction to the monetary policies implemented that year.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\" style=\"font-family: Lato;\"><strong>What innovation will come from COVID-19?  <\/strong><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\">It&#8217;s very difficult to predict, but perhaps we can start by looking at the problems that have surfaced. Many small businesses in Europe and the US are at risk because they do not have enough runway money that lasts further than a month. Because of this financial worry, taxes may also be concerning to these businesses as they have to make sure they are paying on time and the right amount, so they may utilize the resources of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.jamesstanley.co.uk\/small-business-accountants.html\">small business accountants Birmingham<\/a> services or services within their location, to give them that support during this unbalanced time. In response to these monetary issues, the UK announced the CBILS scheme, and in the US small businesses have been allocated a total of $350 billion. In France, hardship grants of up to \u20ac1,500 a month have been made available to small business owners. However, central banks either cannot administer this funding fast enough or look to a third party to do so. In the UK many have not received the funds and in the US the packages are administered by fintechs such as PayPal, Intuit, and Funding Circle, services that come at a fee for central banks. Due to infrastructure, central banks across the world are either struggling to send funds to companies in a timely fashion or are hit by fees from the private sector to do so.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"font-family: Lato;\"><b>Could CBDCs be a solution to recently encountered problems?<\/b><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\">What could be a solution? CBDCs. Central banks need a solution to bring efficiency with the transfer of value, and CBDCs bring this by utilising a shared infrastructure. CBDCs are gaining significant momentum, too. Since the outbreak of COVID-19, there have been some major movements from governments regarding CBDC adoption:<\/p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li1\"><strong>24 March:<\/strong> China completes basic function of \u2018top priority&#8217; digital Yuan<\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><strong>29 March:<\/strong> Digital Dollar mentioned in three bills in the US<\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><strong>1 April:<\/strong> Banque de France begins experimenting with digital euro<\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><strong>6 April:<\/strong> Deutsche Bank encourages CBDC developments<\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><strong>6 April:<\/strong> South Korea central bank plans to pilot CBDC<\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><strong>21 April:<\/strong> Dutch Central Bank wants to do a CBDC trial<\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><strong>11 May:<\/strong> European Central Bank steps up CBDC efforts<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"p1\">This is not an exception, either. CBDCs were building momentum before the outbreak. According to a 2019 report issued by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), a Switzerland-based organization representing 62 of the world&#8217;s central banks, 70% of financial authorities worldwide were researching the potential effects that CBDCs could have on their economies.<\/p>\n\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"w-separator size_small with_line width_default thick_1 style_solid color_custom align_center\" style=\"border-color:#ededed;color:#ededed;\"><div class=\"w-separator-h\"><\/div><\/div><div class=\"w-image align_center\"><div class=\"w-image-h\"><img width=\"1500\" height=\"450\" src=\"https:\/\/tokeny.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/1.png\" class=\"attachment-full size-full\" alt=\"CBDCs Adoption\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https:\/\/tokeny.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/1.png 1500w, https:\/\/tokeny.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/1-300x90.png 300w, https:\/\/tokeny.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/1-1024x307.png 1024w, https:\/\/tokeny.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/1-150x45.png 150w, https:\/\/tokeny.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/1-400x120.png 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px\" \/><\/div><\/div><div class=\"w-separator size_small with_line width_default thick_1 style_solid color_custom align_center\" style=\"border-color:#ededed;color:#ededed;\"><div class=\"w-separator-h\"><\/div><\/div><div class=\"g-cols wpb_row  type_default valign_top vc_column-gap-20 vc_inner \"><div class=\"vc_col-sm-12 wpb_column vc_column_container\"><div class=\"vc_column-inner\"><div class=\"wpb_wrapper\">\r\n\t<div class=\"wpb_text_column \">\r\n\t\t<div class=\"wpb_wrapper\">\r\n\t\t\t<h3 class=\"p2\" style=\"font-family: Lato;\"><b>CBDCs could be hugely beneficial in times of crisis<\/b><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\">So why are CBDCs gaining so much traction?

The industry is well aware of the benefits of utilizing a blockchain in regards to the issuance and management of financial securities (i.e. tokenization), but so far, has been held back by understandable fears in price volatility. A common CBDC would allow financial institutions to take a best of both worlds approach in utilising FIAT and unlock the tremendous benefits of asset tokenization. To this end, we have identified four significant benefits that asset tokenization would unlock for capital markets:<\/p>\n\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"w-separator size_small with_line width_default thick_1 style_solid color_custom align_center\" style=\"border-color:#ededed;color:#ededed;\"><div class=\"w-separator-h\"><\/div><\/div><div class=\"w-image align_center vc_custom_1589379683399\"><div class=\"w-image-h\"><img width=\"1500\" height=\"450\" src=\"https:\/\/tokeny.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/2.png\" class=\"attachment-full size-full\" alt=\"Benefits of CBDCs to tokenization\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https:\/\/tokeny.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/2.png 1500w, https:\/\/tokeny.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/2-300x90.png 300w, https:\/\/tokeny.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/2-1024x307.png 1024w, https:\/\/tokeny.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/2-150x45.png 150w, https:\/\/tokeny.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/2-400x120.png 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px\" \/><\/div><\/div><div class=\"w-separator size_small with_line width_default thick_1 style_solid color_custom align_center\" style=\"border-color:#ededed;color:#ededed;\"><div class=\"w-separator-h\"><\/div><\/div>\r\n\t<div class=\"wpb_text_column \">\r\n\t\t<div class=\"wpb_wrapper\">\r\n\t\t\t<h6 class=\"p1\"><b>Accessibility of private markets<\/b><\/h6>\n<p class=\"p1\">In times of crisis private markets offer higher yields and very interesting opportunities for investors. It&#8217;s for this reason private markets have been booming for the last few years. Yet, due to the lack of a market infrastructure, private market investments are extremely localized and inaccessible &#8211; making it difficult for investors to find opportunities and troublesome for issuers to manage their investors.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Private markets would benefit significantly from the use of a shared infrastructure because there is a clear need from investors who want more data, more transparency and the ability to act rapidly. These needs become even more important in times of crisis. By applying trust, compliance and control on a shared infrastructure, market participants can unlock transferability and improve liquidity in an industry that has been starved of it.<\/p>\n<h6 class=\"p1\"><b>Improved clearing process<\/b><\/h6>\n<p class=\"p1\">Currently, clearing houses act as central counterparties to both sides of a trade and due to rules and regulations these actors are required to maintain records of information around transaction and counterparty risks, along with the cost of reconciling each party&#8217;s data at each step of the contract execution. This results in a process that leads to long settlement periods of T+2 or T+3, human error and a costly allocation of resources.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">CBDCs would improve this process by acting as the catalyst for the use of a shared ledger used to reconcile records through cryptographic hashes. Transactional data can be instantly accessed and approved by authorised parties, drastically improving settlement times, accuracy and resource allocation.<\/p>\n<h6 class=\"p1\"><b>Cap table management<\/b><\/h6>\n<p class=\"p1\">Many processes within capital markets are manual. Cap table management is a notable example. Most companies have a paper-based registry of shareholders. Every time there is a change in the cap table, managers or agents manually update it. Corporate actions such as stock splits, communications and dividend payouts can further complicate matters when processed by manual methods.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Through the use of a blockchain, one can create a set of smart contracts that represent the assets and their investor eligibility rules and linking this to the company&#8217;s onchain identity, firms can benefit from a tokenized <a href=\"https:\/\/earlygrowthfinancialservices.com\/blog\/what-is-a-capitalization-table\/\">cap table<\/a>. Business owners are now able to remove the burden of manually updating their cap tables by implementing a digital-first system that allows them to access real time information. Transfers become faster, cheaper and available on a digital interface.<\/p>\n<h6 class=\"p1\"><b>Compliance enforcement<\/b><\/h6>\n<p class=\"p1\">Due to rules and regulations, laws that are getting stricter every year, issuers are required to create, maintain store information on their investors. From the lack of infrastructure, each institution has to store this information on centralised networks, creating vast amounts of work duplication and wasted resources.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">This process is improved drastically through the use of a shared infrastructure and the appropriate tools for actors to enforce compliance. Using signatures or cryptographic hashes allows data to be shared on chain whilst proving validity from KYC providers without sharing personal and sensitive information. Duplicate checks are not required, driving efficiency in the process. This is one particular area that could save the industry around $160 million annually in cost saving, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.finextra.com\/blogposting\/17857\/blockchain-use-cases-for-banks-in-2020\">Goldman Sachs<\/a>.<\/p>\n\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"w-separator size_small\"><\/div>\r\n\t<div class=\"wpb_text_column \">\r\n\t\t<div class=\"wpb_wrapper\">\r\n\t\t\t<h3 class=\"p2\" style=\"font-family: Lato;\"><strong>Our Take<br \/>\n<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\">CBDCs will eventually unlock huge benefits for capital markets. When this will happen is not so clear but the race between governments is heating up. Stablecoins are gaining significant developments too. Total supply of the top five fiat-backed stablecoins has increased by over 25 percent, primarily led by U.S. dollar-pegged Tether (USDT) on the Ethereum network, with over $1.5 billion in issuance since March 12. It&#8217;s difficult to say exactly when digital currencies will achieve mainstream adoption but for sure a race is ramping up between the major global economies. COVID-19 could be just the crisis CBDCs have needed for major economies to spring into action.<\/p>\n\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n<\/div><\/div><\/div><div class=\"vc_col-sm-12 wpb_column vc_column_container\"><div class=\"vc_column-inner\"><div class=\"wpb_wrapper\"><div class=\"w-separator size_small\"><\/div><div class=\"w-sharing type_simple align_left color_default\" style=\"font-size:1.2rem;\"><div class=\"w-sharing-list\" data-sharing-url=\"https:\/\/tokeny.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/30524\" data-sharing-image=\"https:\/\/tokeny.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/CBDC-1024x630.png\"><a class=\"w-sharing-item email\" title=\"Email this\" href=\"javascript:void(0) \"><span class=\"w-sharing-icon \"><\/span><\/a><a class=\"w-sharing-item facebook\" title=\"Share this\" href=\"javascript:void(0) \"><span class=\"w-sharing-icon \"><\/span><\/a><a class=\"w-sharing-item twitter\" title=\"Tweet this\" href=\"javascript:void(0) \"><span class=\"w-sharing-icon \"><\/span><\/a><a class=\"w-sharing-item linkedin\" title=\"Share this\" href=\"javascript:void(0) \"><span class=\"w-sharing-icon \"><\/span><\/a><a class=\"w-sharing-item whatsapp\" title=\"Share this\" href=\"javascript:void(0) \"><span class=\"w-sharing-icon \"><\/span><\/a><\/div><\/div><div class=\"w-separator size_medium with_line width_default thick_1 style_solid color_border align_center with_content\"><div class=\"w-separator-h\"><h6 class=\"w-separator-text\"><span>Author<\/span><\/h6><\/div><\/div><div class=\"g-cols wpb_row  type_default valign_top vc_inner \"><div class=\"vc_col-sm-1\/5 wpb_column vc_column_container\"><div class=\"vc_column-inner\"><div class=\"wpb_wrapper\"><\/div><\/div><\/div><div class=\"vc_col-sm-1\/5 wpb_column vc_column_container\"><div class=\"vc_column-inner\"><div class=\"wpb_wrapper\"><\/div><\/div><\/div><div class=\"vc_col-sm-1\/5 wpb_column vc_column_container\"><div class=\"vc_column-inner\"><div class=\"wpb_wrapper\"><div class=\"w-person layout_simple_circle\" itemscope itemtype=\"https:\/\/schema.org\/Person\"><div class=\"w-person-image\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"300\" src=\"https:\/\/tokeny.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Tokeny-CEO.jpg\" class=\"attachment-full size-full\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https:\/\/tokeny.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Tokeny-CEO.jpg 300w, https:\/\/tokeny.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Tokeny-CEO-150x150.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/div><div class=\"w-person-content\"><h4 class=\"w-person-name\" itemprop=\"name\"><span>Luc Falempin<\/span><\/h4><div class=\"w-person-role\" itemprop=\"jobTitle\">Tokeny Solutions CEO<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><div class=\"vc_col-sm-1\/5 wpb_column vc_column_container\"><div class=\"vc_column-inner\"><div class=\"wpb_wrapper\"><\/div><\/div><\/div><div class=\"vc_col-sm-1\/5 wpb_column vc_column_container\"><div class=\"vc_column-inner\"><div class=\"wpb_wrapper\"><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/section>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"As discussed in the newsletter this month that looked at CBDCs, with many stimulus packages announced, unemployment levels eclipsing those of 2008 in the US and debt rising to extraordinarily high levels, it's no doubt we are in a time of crisis.
